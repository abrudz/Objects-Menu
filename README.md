# Recent objects menu for APL
Creates a menu which allows the creation of new objects through Dyalog, and displays the 9 (maximum) most recently edited objects. Clicking on one of these recently edited objects will open up the edit window for that object.

# Installation Process
I have tried to make the install as simple as possible:
- Open the Install.dyapp file by double clicking it or running âŽ•SE.SALT.Boot passing the filepath to the right.
- Make sure you save your session. The install is relevant to the session.

# Usage
The menu sits in the IDE menu bar and will display a list of recently edited functions, objects, etc. in the dropdown. Clicking one of these menu items will lead you to the editor. Extra functionality includes the ability to add all kinds of structures via a sub-menu.
